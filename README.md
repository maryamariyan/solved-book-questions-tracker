# solved-book-questions-tracker

This cross platform console application can keep track of questions solved while reading a course book

You can create specific books with known chapters count and question count per chapter by just modifying the BookFactory class.

The app can keep track of the time you spend while solving a question.

Program.cs shows how this works.
